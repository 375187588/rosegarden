// NOTES:
//
// I just had the idea to do a little QProcess paint by numbers deal like the
// LilyPondProcessor as the backend for two new features.  Instead of having all
// that garbage about sudo modprobe blah blah blah, have something like
//
// "I can try to fix this for you.  Blah blah blah.  Rosegarden must restart
// now."
//
// Probably keep track of attempted_to_fix_midi and attempted_to_fix_audio so we
// don't encourage the user to keep hitting the fix it button repeatedly to see
// if maybe it will eventually work.  In practice, on Jaunty, there is no more
// alsaconf and that recommendation is pointless.  About all you can try to do
// is modprobe snd-seq-midi.  The snd-rtctimer whatever does not work either.
//
// FOLLOWUP TO SELF:
//
// No, we wouldn't want to prevent trying it again, because it could be going
// from boot to boot, not just run to run.
//
// QProcessing out sudo seems like a tall enough order that when mixed with the
// low probability of any of these attempts actually working, it's probably time
// to dump this idea and not get carried away.
//
// Likewise the problem of "rebooting" Rosegarden, although this is less tricky
// to get right.
//
// Sleep on it though.  Who knows.
//
// Also, additional thought, on my default out of the box, JACK won't start with
// -R, so if I do all of the above, another nugget to try is writing a different
// jackdrc without -R 
//
// This leads to thoughts about having different kinds of MIDI and audio
// warnings, and keeping up with them.  Probably leave the simple yes/no for
// MIDI and audio warnings, but have some kind of function to attach different
// messages to the /!\ warning icon, and some things to add to the list are:
//
// * Chris's newly refactored autoconnect logic couldn't find a plausible looking
// thing to talk to, so you probably need to run QSynth now &c.
//
// * ??
//
//
// Wrap-up thoughts for today 8-1-2009
//
// The hasGoodMidi() etc. stuff is a mixed bag.  It's redundant and there's
// already working, more verbose code to do two of the three jobs, so I should
// probably just pull all of that out.
//
// SeqMan::checkDriverStatus(true) or whatever is largely if not completely
// redundant, and should probably be cleaned up all the way out of existence
//
// The timer stuff isn't as cut and dried, because this condition is not
// detected in a static way.  There will need to be a mechanism for catching
// this and setting the warning at that time.
//
// I suppose the easiest way to do that is to just do it where it was originally
// done, using the original mechanism where AlsaDriver threw a
// SendMessage::YourShitIsWhackDawg and SeqMan caught it and puked up a big
// blather of text.
//
// Maybe pass SequenceManager a pointer to the WarningWidget so SequenceManager
// can manipulate it directly, and save a translation layer.  That could work.
// That leaves all the error texts back in SequenceManager where they started,
// and probably makes translators lives easier too, since those won't be marked
// as obsolete strings and removed
//
// What happens if you just change part of some long text.  How smart is Qt
// anyway?  I have the general impression it's not really that smart about that
// kind of thing, and it's prone to losing translations that would have only
// needed minor tweaking.  Should investigate that, I suppose, by starting off
// with some of the original dialog texts verbatim, and then seeing what happens
// if I change them around a bit.  Ultimately I want the warnings reworded, and
// a lot less wordy.  See top of this brainstorm block for thoughts about how to
// manage that.
