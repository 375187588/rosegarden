     * under ~ somewhere, eg. ~/tmp or maybe even a Qt class can figure it out
     * so we don't have to)
     *
     * THOUGHTS: let's use ~/rosegarden-project-packager-tmp and warn if it
     * isn't empty when we start, etc.  We'll want to do this in userland in
     * case they have a partitioning scheme that limits system disk usage.  Most
     * users don't bother with this kind of thing these days, but I do, and I
     * can't be alone.
     *
     * What we'll want to do is take the full path/to/filename coming into this
     * thing for later use, and in the interim we work with the "basename" part
     * of the filename, relative to this temporary working location.  Let's
     * build it like
     *
     * ~/rosegarden-project-packager-tmp/m_filename.rg
     * ~/rosegarden-project-packager-tmp/m_filename/[included files]
     *
     * Then once the whole shebang is rolled up, copy it back to the fully
     * qualified original filename, in the originally specified location.
     *
     * The whole scheme as currently laid out may not yet have enough QProcess
     * chain links to get every operation done, but if so, that's why we have
     * text editors and fingers, right?
     *
     *
     *
     * 3. save/cp m_filename.rg to eg. /tmp/$m_filename.rg (NOTE: don't assume
     * the code that called us in RosegardenMainWindow is at all sacred.)
     * 2. mkdir m_filename there (eg. /tmp/$m_filename)
     * 4. cp extracted audioFiles from $audioPath/$audioFiles to /tmp/$m_filename/$audioFiles (use iterator as in sample code below)
     * 5. run external flac utility on /tmp/$m_filename/$audioFiles
     * 6. prompt for additional files, and add them under /$m_filename directory if any
     * 7. run tar czf command that includes ./$m_filename.rg and ./m_filename directory
     * &c.
     * (at some stage in the overall process we need to change the audio path,
     * manager->setAudioPath() to point to...  Hrm.  Not sure how to handle
     * this, actually, as audio paths stored internally are absolute except for
     * the ~ but we probably can't know where this will actually be extracted,
     * so we're probably going to get that wrong.  I think this is something the
     * original script never got right either.  So we probably want to do that
     * when UN-packing, after we KNOW where the files are.  Instead of feeding
     * the user a "can't find audio file rg-123.wav, use this file dialog to
     * point me at it because I'm Rosegarden and I'm brain damaged"
     *
     * save this for one of the last things to refine later and don't worry
     * overmuch going in)
